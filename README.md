This is a modified focus list kind of "To-Do" apps:-
1. Here you can list down your daily focused works and work on then one by one.
2. Design is bit modified keeping in mind of gaining attention of user so that they can use smoothly.
3. I have also built shiny login/signup pages:-

4. Here is the final UI and I have also added a subtle hover animation once you hover at a perticular list, just to maintain interactivity.
